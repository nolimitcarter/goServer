## Malware Development toolkit

* First off, this project was made for fun. I don't encourage using any parts of this repo for malicious purposes. I would rather people focus on how the code is written, and setup. 

* malware compatible with all versions of Windows

### Intro: 

1. C/C++ (malware/bot)
  * FUD TCP based reverse shell 
  * FUD TCP bind shell
2. GoLang & Python 3 (server/handler)
  * Handler which supports multiple connections (Python 3)
3. WINAPI (windows sockets)

4. Mingw-g++ compiler flags/options (to reduce the size of the binary)

5. Elasticsearch and kibana (for visualizing the systems, users, etc.)
  * Handle multiple connections of bots and displaying info on them
